### **CS 81, Module 3B Math Toolkit, by GregH, 7/7/25**

**math.js** has several custom math functions and code to provide example output of the functions. If you run math.js, it will provide output from all its functions. 

**PREDICTIONS.md** has predictions which I wrote before testing each function. 

**RESULTS.md** has output results copied from each function. 

**REFLECTION.md** has info about what was hard and easy about this assignment, what I learned, and how it could be useful.
