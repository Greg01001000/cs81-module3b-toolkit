I think the double() function will take one numeric argument and return that number multiplied by two.

I believe the square() function will take one numeric argument and return that number multiplied by itself.

I hope the isEven() function will take one numeric argument and return true if that number is even, or false if the number is odd. I'm not confident about this one because I used this code--!(n % 2)--which I hope will evaluate 0 as true and 1 as false. I'm at the mercy of JavaScript's quirks here. I can't wait to find out!
