### **CS 81, Module 3B Math Toolkit, by GregH, 7/7/25**

#### What patterns or surprises did you notice?  
The most remarkable pattern I noticed is that in JavaScript, everything worked, more so than any previous language when I have been this early in the learning process. That might be partly because I've learned and gotten better at coding by learning various languages, but I think it's also because JavaScript is designed to be cooperative and forgiving. I was surprised that !!(n % 2) and -n both worked the way I hoped, and that I didn't encounter any slight math inaccuracies, as I did in the commute assignment (because I live so close to SMC that I used tenths of a mile, and binary numbers and tenths don't like each other).  

Git, on the other hand, was a nightmare. I'm glad I'm learning it--I know it's important, but--I took the assignment instruction literally which said, "Create a file called math.js inside your GitHub repo." I just created the file with my standard identifying note at the top and didn't know that after doing that, I should do a git clone or pull before creating the same file in my local repo. Before that became a problem, I followed the assignment instruction which said, 'Commit and push your function with a clear message (e.g., “Add double function”).' I copied and pasted the example message, including the quotes, into my command line without noticing that they are slanty quotes, not straight quotes. Using those quotes to enclose my commit message caused Git to think that I wasn't finished entering my commit command, but I didn't know that, although I knew the command hadn't worked, and everything I tried entering after that just made it worse, because Git kept thinking I was continuing to enter portions of the commit command, and it continued not understanding what I was trying to do. Google AI and Stack Overflow weren't helping, but claude.ai eventually figured out what was happening and told me to hit Ctrl+C, which aborted the command but left Git unresponsive. I had to exit Terminal and restart it. Then when I tried again with Git, it kept saying 'permission denied' without even asking for my username or password. When claude.ai helped me clear my credentials so I could re-enter them, then I realized that my correct credentials didn't give me access to my new GitHub repo. When I tried to update my token on GitHub to get access to my new repo, I repeatedly clicked to select read-write access my new repo, and the next web page repeatedly said my token had no access to it, until I realized that I needed to open the Permissions list and individually click on each Permission type (there are dozens) that I need. (I don't know which ones I need, and reading all the unfamiliar descriptions took much time.) I also did that when getting started with my first repo, and I suspect I'm doing that part wrong, because it's so confusing and time-consuming. But it worked, which is how I found out that Git did not want to push my math.js from my local repo to GitHub, because a different math.js was already there. Claude.ai helped me solve that eventually. It was a learning experience (I think I learned, the hard way, how to avoid and solve two of those three problems, but not the token repo access time-sucker), but all that took about three hours, which was very frustrating when I'm already behind and trying to catch up.

Please remove the slanty quotes from the example commit message in instruction #3 for this assignment, or add a warning to that instruction not to paste the slanty quotes into a command line. And please add a reminder to clone the GitHub repo to one's computer after creating it with the specified files (and maybe clarify the instruction to create math.js in GitHub? I don't know what the purpose of that was). And please provide, somehow, an explanation of how to set up our token with the needed permissions to our repos. I believe many future students will greatly benefit from these simple changes.

#### What logic challenged your thinking?  
Trying to figure out why Git and GitHub weren't working for me was by far the biggest challenge. The most challenging logic in JavaScript was accepting that everything worked, including !!(n % 2) and -n.

#### How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?  
If a program which uses these math functions needs to be more readable to inexperienced coders, and code length and execution speed are not priorities, this toolkit would help achieve that. Of course, a similar toolkit with more complicated functions, especially if a program uses them repeatedly, could reduce development time and code length while improving readability and maintainability. It could even be useful to multiple programs, if it is made available. I believe those are called libraries.
